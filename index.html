<h1> My favourite hobby </h1>
<h4> !!!Reading!!!</h4>
<br>
<p> Reading is my favourite hobby. I like reading because it is very relaxing, it makes me calm and it also makes me feel happy. I read specific books that have specific genres. For example, I like comedy and The Diary Of A Wimpy Kid series is full of comedy. I also like mystery books and the Magic Misfits series or the Harry Potter series is also mystery and solving crimes and stuff. Reading is very fun and you should read too!</p>
